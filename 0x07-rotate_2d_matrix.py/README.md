# Rotate 2D Matrix

This project involves writing a function to rotate a 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A 2D matrix represented as a list of lists

## Example

Given the following 2D matrix:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

After rotation, the matrix will be:

```
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
```
