# Minimum Operations

This project folder contains a solution to the "Minimum Operations" problem.

## Problem Statement

In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` characters `H` in the file.

The only operations you can perform are:
1. Copy All: You can copy all the characters present in the file.
2. Paste: You can paste the characters you have copied.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To run the solution, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 minimum_operations.py <n>
```

Replace `<n>` with the desired number of characters `H`.

## Example

```bash
python3 minimum_operations.py 9
```

Output:
```
6
```
