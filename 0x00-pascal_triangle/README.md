# Pascal's Triangle

This directory contains a project focused on generating Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. Each number is the sum of the two directly above it.

## Files

- `0-pascal_triangle.py`: A Python script that contains a function to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Example

For `n = 5`, the output will be:

```
[
    [1],
    [1, 1],
   [1, 2, 1],
  [1, 3, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```
