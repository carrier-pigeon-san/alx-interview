# 0x05. N Queens

## Description
This project is part of the ALX Interview series. It focuses on solving the N Queens problem, a classic algorithmic puzzle. The objective is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand backtracking algorithms.
- Implement a solution to the N Queens problem.
- Optimize algorithms for performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Code should follow PEP 8 style guidelines.

## Usage
To run the N Queens solution, execute the following command:
```bash
python3 nqueens.py N
```
Replace `N` with the desired size of the chessboard.

## Example
```bash
$ python3 nqueens.py 4
[1, 3, 0, 2]
[2, 0, 3, 1]
```
